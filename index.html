        <h3>5. Fucking Tabark's cat</h3>
        <p class="txt">Literally the worst kind of cat. All it does is fucking sleep and eat. And when you want to play with her, she doesn't even react. Like at one time I wanted to pet her, and that mf just ignored me????? Who loves thses? I fully believe whomever loves them just loves pain. And you know what's the funniest part? They adopted another one. THEY ADOPTED ANOTHER USELSS CAT THAT ALL IT DOES IS JUST SLEEPING AND EXISITING. LITERALLY WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER? Anyways, 0/10 hope they get well soon from whatever they suffer from</p>

        <h3>4. The devil itself</h3>
        <p class="txt">He is one of my aunt's cats. He looks depressed, because quite frankly he might be. I remember one time he fled the apartment and we were looking out for him. But then he just appeared out of nowhere. Like???? Mf just tell us before hand gang. He is the most depressed out of all my aunt's cats. Which says a lot. cause he is still more active and playful than that fuckass Tabark's cat(like geniunly wtf is wrong with her man)</p>

        <h3>3. The horny one</h3>
        <p class="txt">"Wow, Ahmed. You are being vulgar." AM I THOUGH???? The one who is infront of the window(the one who is inside) was just meowing and making a fuss inside the room I am sleeping in. Why did we trap him inside my room? Cause there was two euthanized cats inside the house. One of them had to be trapped. And you know what's funny? THEY BOTH ARE MALES. THAT MF IS SO HORNY HE CAN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES(side note, the one who outside the window is a heterochromia cat)</p>

        <h3>2. My cat</h3>
        <p class="txt">He looks weird but that's because he is African. He is fine. He makes me laugh sometimes. But more often than not he just makes the house miserable. He destroyed everything that comes in contact wit his beak- I mean fangs. Fangs of course. Still waiting for him to meow though.</p>

        <h4>Tabark's cat again</h4>
        <p class="txt">Like just why? Why adopt her at all? She is a fucking deadmeat basically</p>

        <h3>1. Phoebe</h3>
        <p class="txt">(I couldn't find a picture of her. Also yes, she is named after Friends's Phoebe) Those are her children btw. She is basically the mother of all the other cats(inluding the devil himself) I remember when I arrived at my aunt's apartment. Phoebe was on labour and she couldn't give birth. So the poor baby had to to c-section surgers. And for weeks, she couldn't breatfeed her children and needed extreme care when it comes to handling her. She deserves no.1 imo just because of the pain she went thru. Otherwise, she is a bitch. </p>
